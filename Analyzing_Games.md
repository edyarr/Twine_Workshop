### 2. Analyxing Twine Games

Twine is an open source platforme used to create both games and interactive stories. There is a big community of creators who publish games on diverse platforms. However, the most interesting part is that Twine offers tye possibility of publishing interactive stories: the reader gets to decide whatthe path is. 

In twine we have the option of creating diverse types of games:
- Competitive
- Communal

#### Some examples: 

- Anna Anthropy. *Queers in Love at the End of the World* (2013) <https://w.itch.io/end-of-the-world>
- Mary Standfield et al. *A Witch's World!* (2016) <https://rainbowstarbird.itch.io/a-witchs-word>
- Tylyn Johnson. *Communal Creativity: A Game of Poetry* (2022) <https://tykywrites.itch.io/communalcreativity>

#### Activity. 

* Select one of the games (we need to analyze all of them)
* Play the game
* Take notes discussing: 
    * What is the type of game you payed?
    * What is the game's argument?
    * What design decisions ( at the level of narratie and mechanics) contribute to this argument?
    * How is it interactive? Explain
    * Who is the intended audience?
    * What is the relationship between you, the player, and the player character (the character controlled by the player)?
    * What identities do you thinks these narratives games are representing?
    * How do you evaluate their process of representation?
    * What would you change from both the user experience and the representational point of vie?
