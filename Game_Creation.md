## Workshop Strucure

1. Creating Narratives as an Act of Re-existence (a decolonial perspective)
2. Analyzing Twine Game
3. Playing with Twine
4. **Developing your own game/story**

### 4. **Developing your own game/story**

This is the final stage of the workshop. In this activity, I want you to develop your own game. You need the follow the plan as proposed below: 

1. Select a topic from the following list
      1. Topic A
      2. Topic B
      3. Topic C
      4. Topic D
      5. Topic E
      6. Topic F
      7. Topic G

2. Barinstorm ideas of a plot and the narrative progression. You can use pen and paper. Draw the structure you think will work the best when working on Twine (you must have some ideas now)
3. Create a network of passages, links and choices. You can have 2 types of choices: 
      1. Fair choice: The Player understands the relationship between the choice and the outcome. If no additional context is given, this choice is unfair because the consequences appear random and are not logically connected to the player’s choice
      2. Meaningful choice: It’s a choice that matters. It’ll likely connects to the game’s outcome. If the choices take you to the same consequence, the choice is meaningless because there is not emotional weight. However, the meaningless choice could be used rhetorically to create a feeling of powerlessness. 
4. Start working on Twine. Your game must have, at minimum, the following elements: 
      1. Passages
      2. Links
      3. Choices
      4. Images
      5. Sound
      6. Styled Text
      7. One high level macro
