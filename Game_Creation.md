3. Playing with Twine
4. **Developing your own game/story**

### 4. **Developing your own game/story**

This is the final stage of the workshop. In this activity, I want you to develop your own game. You need to follow the plan as proposed below: 

1. Select a topic from the following list (all topics/sentences are real testimonies or belong to common discourse in countries in the Americas or the Caribbean)
      1. -	"You don't look like the type that could do that. You don't look like you're paying attention in class" (Teacher to Afro-Latinx Student getting straight A's in class, Connecticut)
      2. -	"Do not to go out into the sun so that your skin won't get darker" (Latino parents to kids, diverse countries)
      3. -	"Straighten your hair, so you can come to work and look professional" (Parents to kids and supervisors to employees in diverse countries)
      4. -	"You say you are Latinx or Afro-Latinx, but your Spanish is not good enough. You get kicked out of the classroom" (Testimony of a high school student from Vermont)
      5. -	"Her classmates harassed Alma, an Afro-Latinx student, calling her slurs such as 'negra sucia' (dirty Negro), 'pelo malo' (bad hair) and 'mona'" (monkey) (Testimony of Puerto Rican Student)
      6. -	"I received discipline cards for acting out in class or talking too loud" (Testimony of Afro-Latinx student from Connecticut)
      7. One personal topic that you find appealing

2. Barinstorm ideas of a plot and the narrative progression. You can use pen and paper. Draw the structure you think will work the best when working on Twine (you must have some ideas now)
3. Create a network of passages, links and choices. You can have 2 types of choices: 
      1. Fair choice: The Player understands the relationship between the choice and the outcome. If no additional context is given, this choice is unfair because the consequences appear random and are not logically connected to the player’s choice
      2. Meaningful choice: It’s a choice that matters. It’ll likely connects to the game’s outcome. If the choices take you to the same consequence, the choice is meaningless because there is not emotional weight. However, the meaningless choice could be used rhetorically to create a feeling of powerlessness. 
4. Start working on Twine. Your game must have, at minimum, the following elements: 
      1. Passages
      2. Links
      3. Choices
      4. Images
      5. Sound
      6. Styled Text
      7. One high level macro
