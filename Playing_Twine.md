## Workshop Structure

1. Creating Narratives as an Act of Re-existence (a decolonial perspective)
2. Analyzing Twine Games
3. **Playing with Twine**
4. Developing your own game/story

### **3. Playing with Twine** 

As we discussed, Twine is an open source platform used to create games/interactive stories. You can use the tool both on the browser or locally on your desktop. Regardless of what option you select, your games/stories will be previewed on your browser because Twine produces an HTML file. For this workshop, we will use Twine as a browser applicaion though. 

Please follow the next steps: 
* Go to [Twine](https://twinery.org/) 
* Click on the `Online` option. You'll be promted to the Twine dashboard (see image below).

In the dashboard you'll find the follwoing menu: 
* Story
* Library
* Build
* View
* Twine

Each of the links will have sub-menus. For instance, `Story` has the following sub-menu: 
* New
* Edit
* Tag
* Rename
* Duplicate
* Delete

Let's explore each of the menus and sub-menus. Click without hesitation. Your computer won't break. The worst that can happen is that we have to delete something we didn't intend to do.


#### **What are we going to do in this section?**

* Identify basic features on Twine. Once you do so, we will be able to start working on some initial operations;   
* Get acquainted with Twine's language/concepts such as:
    * Passage
    * Link
    * Choice
    * Solution
    * Styling
* Play with Twine by experimenting with each of the above concepts; 
* Close-read a test game I created (*A Grad Student in a German University*) for this part of the workshop. We'll analyze the back end of the game so we can learn the above concepts and other more advaced operations.
