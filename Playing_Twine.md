#### What are we going to do in this section

* Identify basic features of Twine
* Get acquainted with Twine's language
    * Passage
    * Link
    * Choice
    * Solution
    * Styling
* Play with Twine so we can learn the hard way

To do so, I have created a test game: *A Grad Student in a German University* We'll create the game/story using a cheat sheet that I have created and compiled for your use.
