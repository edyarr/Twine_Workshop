## Workshop Structure

1. **Creating Narratives as an Act of Re-existence (a decolonial perspective)**
2. Analyzing Twine Games
3. Playing with Twine
4. Developing your own game/story


### 1. Creating Narratives as an Act of Re-existence

Narrative creation is a process that defines who we are, what communities we belong to and how our communities are viewed and treated. Coloniality of power has created narratives to classify gendered, racialized and disabled bodies. A way to counter act those narratives is not only through resistence but also through re-existence (Misak people in Colombia). This means that communities that have been pushed to the margins do not need just to "passively" resist impositions but they get to create their own (alternative) worlds. 

As part of this workshop we'll start by pondering and discussing some basic conceptions through **questions** such as:

- Who does get to make/create games/narratives?
- Who does get to tell another person's story?
- What does it mean to represent people and cultures accurantely through narratives?
- How do we reclaim an active role in telling/creating our own stories/games?


Additionally, we are going to discuss some comments and **statements** such as: 

- Think critically about our own positionality when writing/creating games/stories
- Narratives are partial, subjective and constructed 
- The best way to interact and represent communities through narrative is by connecting with them in meaningful ways (caring)
